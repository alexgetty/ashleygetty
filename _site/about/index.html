            <p>I am Ashley, a designer & maker of things who has over 7 years of industry experience in both the print and digital worlds. Much of my career has been spent working at small design studios and agencies, which has allowed me to develop a well-rounded skillset. While I always enjoy the opportunity to build new logos & brands, I have also found that my real love and passion is creating designs that fall within established design systems. I pride myself in my ability to stay flexible and work with my clients to bring their vision to life by assisting in whatever way I am needed—whether it's large or small.</p>
            <p>On any given weekend, you can probably find me in the mountains hiking, backpacking, scaling peaks, or checking out local restaurants & breweries. I love making strong, lasting connections with others, and thrive on making people laugh (and when that fails, I will at least laugh at my own jokes). I also have an unhealthy obsession with bacon. Lastly, I knit about as much as your grandmother’s grandmother. Really—I’m knitting as I type this.</p>
            <p>Now that you know a bit about me, I would love to get to know you! Check out my social media accounts or send me an email at <a href="mailto:ashleymgetty@gmail.com">ashleymgetty@gmail.com</a> if you’d like to talk! I’m always accepting new projects, and of course, free bacon.</p>
