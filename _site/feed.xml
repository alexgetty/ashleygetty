        <description>&lt;p&gt;Vin Sur Vingt is a collection of authentic French Wine bars with locations throughout Manhattan, NYC and is a long-time client of Worboys Design. They came to us looking for a site refresh, as their previous site had been created quite a few years ago and was starting to feel outdated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the lead designer on this project, my role included project/account management, creation of new designs for the new website using Sketch App, and efficient communication with the developer during production. During the redesign, I also worked to improve the overall UX of Vin Sur Vingt’s website by revisiting the setup of the navigation, location info, and menus. Users will now easily be able to find exactly what they are looking for, whether it is a certain location’s menu/contact info, information on catering and private events, or simply to learn more about Vin Sur Vingt and its story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vsvwinebars.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vsvwinebars.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Uplight</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2019 I had the pleasure of doing some contract work for Uplight, an energy software company in Boulder, CO. I assisted the internal design team in whatever way I was needed, creating items that ranged from complex software product mockups to simple ads for print. All designs featured different applications of Uplight’s vibrant, already-existing brand style which was so fun to work with! I’ve included a brief description of each project below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The logo concepts below were created for an internal branding project. Ultimately these concepts did not end up being used but I enjoyed working with the prismatic shapes and colors nonetheless!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;no-shadow&quot; src=&quot;../img/uplight-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Uplight&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I was tasked with updating the product mockups for Uplight's entire software suite. Since Uplight is a relatively new company (formed in 2019 as a merger of 6 different companies in the energy industry), the previous mockup images featured multiple different styles since they were originally taken from each legacy company. I created a new, streamlined style that could be applied to each product mockup. These designs will be used for applications such as marketing collateral and client-facing presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;no-shadow&quot; src=&quot;../img/uplight-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Uplight&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;no-shadow&quot; src=&quot;../img/uplight-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Uplight&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;no-shadow&quot; src=&quot;../img/uplight-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Uplight&quot; /&gt;

        <title>Branded Bicycle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;St Paul Collection, a luxury apartment community located in Denver’s Cherry Creek neighborhood, came to Worboys Design with the unique idea of using branded bicycles as advertising pieces that could be placed around Cherry Creek. Worboys Design had never worked on a project quite like this before, and I had the opportunity to be the sole designer on the project. I began by finding a bike frame that could effectively emulate a luxurious, upscale look &amp;amp; feel. I then used Photoshop to mock up a design that represented the St Paul brand. I found &amp;amp; sourced a local bike vendor to do all the production work for the project - from the paint job &amp;amp; leather details the custom chain guard, signage panel, &amp;amp; crate. The finished product turned out better than my team &amp;amp; I could have imagined, and we are excited to see these bikes pop up in the Cherry Creek neighborhood. Many thanks to Ian at &lt;a href=&quot;http://whiterhinocustoms.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;White Rhino Customs&lt;/a&gt; for his creativity and hard work to help bring this project to completion!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Highland</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Highland Development Company is a real estate development group located in Denver, Colorado. When they came to Worboys Design seeking a website design, they did not have any existing site in place. This was an exciting opportunity for me to start from scratch and create something brand new for HDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the sole designer for this project, and my roles included project/account management, creation of designs for the new website using Sketch App, and efficient communication with the developer during production. The main goal of the website was predominantly for investors to get a good sense of HDC’s numerous accomplishments in the real estate space, while also showcasing their company vision and core values. I wrapped up the project by giving the client a tutorial on the site’s backend (based in WordPress) so they could add new projects, news articles, and copy changes themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highlanddevelopmentco.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;highlanddevelopmentco.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Forden</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The owner of Paige Forden Photography (Paige Kushner) came to Worboys Design looking for a rebrand that could accurately represent her work, process, &amp;amp; personality. Paige takes the time to get to know each and every one of her clients in order to build strong relationships with them, and wanted a brand identity that could portray that. This focus on connection plays a big role in Paige’s work - she is able to capture real, honest moments in the lives of children and families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I began the branding process by creating a mood board, based on some initial research as well as Paige’s overall vision for her new brand. Paige has a bold, edgy style that pairs well with her friendly and approachable demeanor. I wanted to make sure her new brand mirrored that.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Below is the finalized mood board. The soft, natural blush tones work to draw viewers in and make them feel at home while the high-contrast dark colored accents create a polished, refined, and fashionable look. Subtle sage and light grey tones soften up the overall color palette. Together, these colors create an identity that accurately portrays Paige’s passion of capturing pure, authentic moments in the lives of her clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;../img/paigeforden-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;handbell&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once the mood board was finalized, I proceeded to create logo design concepts that would later be presented to the client. I sat down with her to present the logo options and give her insight into the design choices behind each one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;../img/paigeforden-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;handbell&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the end, the below concept was chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;

        <title>Wonderwood</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wonderwood is a rustic lakeside lodge located in Grand Lake, Colorado. I had the pleasure of creating a logo &amp;amp; website for this beautiful alpine getaway. Once the logo design was chosen, I began designing the site. I created a design that allowed the photography of the lodge to speak for itself and create a perfect foundation for the rest of the site. Some of the website’s features include local attractions, an amenities list, photo gallery, and contact info page. I wrote all the site’s copy, and used my hand lettering skills to create a header for each interior page. I then built a responsive website using the Divi plugin on WordPress, which allows a high degree of design customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

        <title>Logos</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Below are some of my favorite logo concepts, showcasing a range of different styles. I am able to adapt my style to accommodate each individual client’s needs—whether it’s iconic, illustrative, or corporate. I find it enjoyable to dabble in new techniques and expand my stylistic repertoire. All concepts were created for clients of Worboys Design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Invites</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two of my favorite types of design work are invitation suites and event collateral. I like to use hand lettering to add unique touches to the designs. When time allows, I also print the invitations using my Epson R2000 printer. It’s always gratifying to see a project through from start to finish in my own home.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Broadstone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Alliance Residential is one of Worboys Design’s largest clients, and we have partnered with them on multiple large-scale multifamily residential branding projects over the years. Broadstone Uptown is the most recent, with construction in full swing as of Spring 2019. This community will be located in the heart of Denver’s vibrant Uptown neighborhood - its interiors a fusion between two contrasting styles that both enhance and complement one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the onset of the project, the client requested the creation of a splash page to serve as a point of contact for potential residents and a source of information regarding construction updates. Prior to this, one of my teammates at Worboys had created a mood board to serve as direction for the project’s overall look and feel. I used this as a starting point which guided the design aesthetic and color palette for the project. A feeling of modern luxury is conveyed in the design, with dueling dark &amp;amp; light sections as well as fine gold accents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The splash page is live and can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.broadstoneuptown.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;broadstoneuptown.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dental</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most unique projects I worked on at Stoner Graphix was this 40’ long mobile dentist’s office for local healthcare provider Capital Blue Cross. Precision was key here, as the vehicle had many windows, doors, and extendable portions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the graphics appear to have been printed on a single piece of material, they were actually broken down to be printed and plotted on 3 different vinyl types. The solid navy blue (background) and bright blue (toothbrush handle) were cut from colored vinyl. Everything else (bristles, bubbles, &amp;amp; text) was digitally printed onto white vinyl, then laminated and plotted from cut paths I created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My involvement in the project included creating a kid-friendly, fun design that adhered to the brand standards of Capital Blue Cross, fitting that design to the supplied vehicle measurements, breaking down the graphics into print-friendly files, producing (printing, laminating, and plotting) all the vinyl, and supplying the production team with measurements for the install.&lt;/p&gt;
